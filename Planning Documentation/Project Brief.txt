Project Brief

For the purposes of completing the group coursework of the Web Development Subject, our group known as TopShooter will be completing a web based Mass Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG). The game that we have agreed on doing is a top down shooter which will be a last person standing game, where a group of six players will fight it out to win the game. 

The game will have unique individual accounts can be created for user to play the game. This can be done by allowing users to create an account, which will be then held on a secure database. Having an account will allow the user's score to be tracked on our scoreboard. The user will be able to log in and out of thier account, and will be able to edit their details.

As for the game itself, all players will be placed into a game map and spaced sensibly at the start, to avoid an instant death. Each character, who each user will control will have a gun which will be used to defeat the other players. To have that multiplayer experience, a designated server will pass data to and from a player's pc. This data will allow a user to show it's movements and actions to other players, and vice versa.

The game will have one static map that will be used for each game. This map will have obstructions that players use as cover. Neither bullets or players can go through obstructions in the map. Scoring will also be featured in games, with points being allocated to killing an enemy player and for winning the game. These scores will be tracked on the leaderboard, providing they have an account, as previously mentioned.

For all members, both account holders and guests, they have the options of looking sending in bug reports to an email designated by the TopShooter Group. They will also have access to a help/support feature which will act as a game manual for our shooting game, allowing all players to get the best experience out of the game.
